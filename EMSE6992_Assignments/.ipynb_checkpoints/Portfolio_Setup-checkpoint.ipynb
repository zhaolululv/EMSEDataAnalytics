    "Below are instructions on how to install, edit, and create a Portfolio. The portfolio template that you will be downloading is a template that I created and which was donated to us by Karl Broman.  All of the pages are in markdown which is really similar to html so editing the files is trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to receive full credit for assignments and final project, you must install the template, personalize the protfolio (entering in your bio/CV/publications/etc.) and send me the link to the newly created portfolio (username.github.io). Not looking for anything perfect here, just want to see your portfolio successfully hosted on Github and want you to show progress towards getting the portfolio to a point that will enable you to build upon in the future.\n",

    "\n",
    "To edit the portolio using Github Desktop, once you have downloaded and installed Github Desktop, go to the file menu and select \"clone repository.\"   This will enable you to clone the Github repository \"username/username.github.io\" to your local computer (make sure to keep track of what directory you cloned the repository to). \n",

    "The next step after changes have been made is to push them to the repository hosted on Github. To do this, you must add a description of the edits to the \"Summary\" text box located on the left lower side of the Github Desktop application and the press the \"Commit to Master\" button on the lower left hand side of the Github Desktop application.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you push the \"Commit to Master\" button, you will now have to push the \"Push Origin\" button on the top right hand side of Github Desktop.\n",
